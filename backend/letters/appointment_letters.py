"""Appointment letters (UC22).

When a coordinator approves a supervisor or panel appointment, the appointment
code saves a new active appointment. ``signals.py`` hears that and, once the
approval is saved for good, calls ``make_letter_after_approval``.

The letter comes from the office's active template for that kind of letter. It
is issued at once and sent to the student and the lecturers on it. If a value
the letter needs is blank, or the template has fields only the office can fill
in, the letter waits in the office's Requests instead. If there is no usable
template, the office is told, and the letter can be made later from Letter
Generation. A failed letter never undoes the approval.
